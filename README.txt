This is a curated selection of runescape music named the Runescape Bright Mix. This is a selection of Runescape music before the RS3 remastering. Basically, I wanted listeners to be able to appreciate ALL of Runescape's notable music and produce a list that's great for the RS experience, and also maybe provide RS content creators with a reference list to use as well.

Some pieces, maybe fewer than 10 were selected for their sentimental value as well. For instance, the quest where Iban shows up was extremely memorable for me, or the piece which appears during the waterfall quest. As a result, Iban has been included in scape dark.

The Runescape Bright Mix tries to include every classic and have been added to the brigt mix folder, even if they sound minor.

There are a number of folders in the Runescape Bright Mix, although for the most part they are separated into major and minor-sounding categories. There are other more miscellaneous or thematic pieces tied to certain areas in Runescape.

Scape Dark is listenable, just like the bright mix. The pieces in scape dark are not chaotic. When I listened through the full soundtrack, anything which was upsetting or distracting enough that it pulled me out of my concentration was tossed. In short, you can still listen to scape dark. It's just not a bright mix.

The Tier 2 folder is just a selection of pieces which I wavered on including in EITHER the bright or dark mix. They are a sub-excellent folder of picks or runner-ups, essentially. 

Folders like Karambwan Tunes are pretty much just a dump though pieces which are definitely uncomfortable to listen to have been excluded. They are NOT comprehensive.

The original archive of this music which I downloaded came with just a few of folders but nonjunkbox was one of them. This folder 'nonjunkbox' was NOT included in this Bright Mix.

The reason this current version is not yet a full release is because something went wrong with how I kept the original files intact, so something is missing and I don't know what is or how to even find the original files. When I tried looking for the archive I initially downloaded, I couldn't find it and only found a completely new archive of music that had at least 50% more songs that I've never heard before. If you know why there are many different versions and copies of runescape music it would help me to know why and which version(s) of the archives I should be using.





~~~~Footnotes about version 0.1
0.1 would have been the first and final version if I didn't get confused by finding out about multiple versions of older runescape music, and also one day not being able to locate the archive of music files which I first downloaded. (I failed to save an original untouched archive of the music that I downloaded) I thought that the original archive that I downloaded contained absolutely everything. However, it misses a few tracks that I would consider pretty old that were released in 2009, such as Ice day for penguins or Kharidian Nights (which I've never heard in my life).

How this was done: Listened through a set of songs just in the background. When each finishesm if I have an impression of it I will move it somewhere. If I'm unsure, I will let the queue run again and move songs out over the queue.

In short, one day I will update a Bright Mix 2.0 and publicize it better.

When I tried to locate the original archive, all I could find was something else which then contained a huge ton more songs that I've never ever heard before, and wasn't organized in the same way like the package I originally downloaded. If anyone might know what I'm looking for, that would be helpful.



todo: not everything is there, like Penguin Possible
Desert Island Bear
Ice day for penguins
penguin prison
Sub way
Add fight or flight to dark
Add root canal to dark
Add isle of everywhere
